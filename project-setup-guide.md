## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Get RAG Working (Week 1)
1. Collect your business documents (PDFs, emails, reports)
2. Run `rag_implementation.py` with your data
3. Test search quality and tune chunk sizes
4. Optimize retrieval performance (aim for >0.7 nDCG@10)

### Phase 2: Add Causal Modeling (Week 2)
1. Gather A/B test or campaign data
2. Run `causal_uplift_modeling.py` with your experiments
3. Validate uplift models with Qini curves (aim for >0.6 AUC)
4. Generate targeting recommendations

### Phase 3: Integration & Deployment (Week 3)
1. Combine systems using `integration_engine.py`
2. Build custom dashboard or use provided template
3. Deploy with FastAPI/Streamlit for live demo
4. Create case study documentation

## 📊 Sample Datasets Included

**Mock Business Documents:**
- Marketing campaign results with ROI data
- Product launch analysis with engagement metrics  
- Customer retention study with segment breakdowns

**Synthetic Experiment Data:**
- 10,000 customer records with features
- Randomized treatment assignments
- Realistic outcome distributions with heterogeneous effects

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### RAG System Tuning:
```python
# In rag_implementation.py
chunk_size = 1000          # Adjust for document type
chunk_overlap = 200        # Balance context vs. precision
similarity_threshold = 0.7  # Filter low-quality matches
top_k_documents = 5        # Number of sources to retrieve
```

### Uplift Model Selection:
```python
# In causal_uplift_modeling.py
meta_learners = {
    'T-Learner': TLearner(learner=RandomForestRegressor()),
    'X-Learner': XLearner(learner=RandomForestRegressor()),
    'R-Learner': RLearner(learner=RandomForestRegressor())
}
```
