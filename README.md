## 🚀 Features
- 📖 **Knowledge Retrieval** – Seamless integration of external knowledge sources for context-aware answers.  
- 🧩 **Causal Reasoning** – Applies causal graphs and inference to uncover relationships beyond correlation.  
- 🤖 **Explainable AI** – Generates not just predictions but also explanations of *why* an outcome occurs.  
- 🔄 **RAG + Causal Fusion** – Bridges the gap between **LLM-based reasoning** and **data-driven causal inference**.  
- ⚡ **Scalable & Modular** – Designed for research, enterprise decision support, and AI product integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Core AI:** Large Language Models (LLMs)  
- **RAG Framework:** Vector search + retrieval pipeline  
- **Causal Intelligence:** Causal graphs, inference, and counterfactual analysis  
- **Deployment:** Python / Node.js backend (flexible setup)
